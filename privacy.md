**CASH Music Privacy Policy**  
Last Updated: January 30, 2013  
  
This Privacy Policy describes how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by CASH 
Music ("CASH Music").  This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you access or use 
our websites, mobile applications or other online or mobile products, services or applications 
(collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.  This Privacy Policy does 
not, however, apply to information that our users may collect and store through the use of our 
Services.  Artists that use CASH Music's Services may collect information about you, and we 
encourage you to ask these artists for more information about their privacy practices before 
providing them with any information.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by 
revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of our Privacy Policy and, in some cases, we may provide 
you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email 
notification).  We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use the 
Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your 
privacy.
